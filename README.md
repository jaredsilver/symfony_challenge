# Symfony Challenge
Experimenting with how much I can learn about a new framework in the span of an average workday

### The Challenge
The goal of this challenge is to see how much I can learn about and implement a new web framework in the span of the an average workday.

### Parameters of the Challenge
I'll be using the Symfony framework to build a small web application over the course of ~8-10 hours (with breaks for food, bathroom, etc.) -- it's meant to simulate what I could accomplish if I was sitting down on day one at a new company with a stack I haven't used before. Though I've used PHP in the past, that was quite some time ago, and I haven't done any modern PHP development recently. I don't even have a LAMP stack set up locally, so this challenge also includes getting the appropriate dev environment up and running.

### What I'm Building
I'm building -- surprise, surprise -- an edtech tool. Back in high school, I built these cool game theory simulators for use in the classroom, but I lost the code a long time ago (and it probably wasn't written very well to begin with). I think it would be reasonable for me to recreate one of these simulations in the given time frame. We'll see what happens ðŸ˜Š

Let's get to it!
